1. Explain the purpose of using the var() function in css.

Ans.The var() function in css is used to insert the value of a CSS variable. we can create variables with local or global scope and use it by using var() function.It     can be defined using the -- prefix followed by a variable name.They allow us to store and reuse values throughout our stylesheet, making it easier to maintain     consistency.

  Purpose of var() Function

     Reusability: CSS variables allow us to store values that we can reuse across our stylesheet. The var()
                  function lets us reference these values wherever needed, reducing redundancy and making our code cleaner.

     Consistency: By using variables, we can ensure consistent values for colors, spacing, fonts, and more
                  throughout our entire design. Changing a variable's value will automatically update all instances where the
                  variable is used.

     Global Changes: If we need to make a design change, we can update the variable's value once, and the
                     change will be applied to all instances using that variable.
